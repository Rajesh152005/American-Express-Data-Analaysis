# American-Express-Data-Analaysis
The main use of this code is to build a Customer Churn Prediction Model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). It helps predict whether a customer will leave (exit) the company, specifically in the context of American Express (AmEx) or any similar business.
🧠 Why is this Important?
Businesses like AmEx want to:

Reduce customer loss (churn)

Understand why customers leave

Take preventive actions (offers, better support, etc.)

Improve customer satisfaction and loyalty

📌 Real-World Example:
Imagine you are a manager at AmEx. You want to find out:

“Which customers are likely to leave next month?”

This code uses customer data like age, gender, account balance, salary, etc., to predict whether they will leave or not.

🔍 What the Code Actually Does:
Step	Purpose
1. Load Dataset	Uses a file AmExUserExit.csv containing customer info.
2. Encode Data	Converts text like "Male"/"Female" into numbers.
3. Scale Features	Standardizes data for better learning.
4. Split Data	Divides into training and test sets.
5. Build Neural Network	Learns patterns from customer behavior.
6. Train Model	Learns from past data (who left, who stayed).
7. Predict Results	Tells whether a new customer is likely to leave.
8. Evaluate Accuracy	Measures how good the predictions are.

🔁 You Can Use This Code To:
Predict churn for banks, telecom companies, online services, etc.

Replace the dataset with your own company’s data.

Build a dashboard for customer success teams.

Alert sales teams about at-risk customers.

Improve marketing strategies.

🚀 Summary:
🧠 This is a machine learning model using a neural network to predict customer churn (exit).
📈 Businesses use it to improve retention and reduce losses.
